# Fandom WikiPeek
**A small but useful script that lets you preview a linked Fandom Wikia article**

When you browse any Fandom wiki website, a short preview will pop up as a tooltip upon hovering over links to other articles from that site. 
It is useful for quickly understanding unfamiliar terms without navigating away from the current page.

Fandom WikiPeek is still an early work in progress. Improvements are still being made, and some bugs have to be fixed (for example, anchor links should ignore redirects). 

## Installation

Install this Userscript in your browser with Greasemonkey (Firefox) or Tampermonkey (Chrome).
